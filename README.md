# Fuel Economy Dataset (1999-2008)

## Overview

This dataset provides a subset of the fuel economy data made available by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on [fueleconomy.gov](https://fueleconomy.gov/). The dataset specifically focuses on 38 popular car models that were consistently released each year between 1999 and 2008. This temporal criterion serves as a proxy for the popularity of the included car models during that period.

## Contents

The dataset encompasses a comprehensive range of information related to the fuel economy of the selected car models, offering valuable insights for researchers, analysts, and enthusiasts interested in the automotive industry. The data fields include, but are not limited to:

- **Model Year:** The year of release for the car model.
- **Manufacturer:** The company that produced the car.
- **Model:** The specific model name of the car.
- **Vehicle Class:** The category or type of the vehicle (e.g., compact, midsize, SUV).
- **Transmission Type:** The type of transmission (automatic, manual).
- **Fuel Type:** The fuel type used by the vehicle (regular, premium, electricity, etc.).
- **City MPG:** The miles per gallon (MPG) in city driving conditions.
- **Highway MPG:** The miles per gallon (MPG) in highway driving conditions.
- **Combined MPG:** The combined city and highway MPG.

## Purpose

This dataset is curated for individuals and organizations interested in analyzing trends and patterns in fuel efficiency across popular car models during the years 1999 to 2008. Researchers and data scientists may find this dataset valuable for conducting exploratory data analysis, building predictive models, or drawing insights into the evolution of fuel efficiency standards in the automotive industry.

## Data Source

The original data is sourced from the official EPA website, [fueleconomy.gov](https://fueleconomy.gov/), where the agency provides a wealth of information related to fuel economy and environmental performance for various vehicles.
